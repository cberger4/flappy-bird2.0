# flappy-bird2.0
A harder version of the iPhone game Flappy Bird.
Created by: Chris Berger
Inspired by: Daniel Shiffman

This game was inspired by Daniel Shiffman (The Coding Train) from his video
of creating Flappy Bird in JavaScript.

My version has added two new types of pipes, the Moving Pipe (movePipe) and the
Collapsing Pipe (colPipe). These pipes will be spawned in pseudo-randomly in an
attempt to not make the game TOO difficult. The game will start with only
regular pipes before introducing the new types.
